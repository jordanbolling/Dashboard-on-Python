<h1>An analysis of Coca-Cola Company's Strategy and HR Activities (2025)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project involved designing a *strategic and HR analytics dashboard* for *Coca-Cola Company*, aiming to address key organisational challenges and support evidence-based decision-making. An interactive dashboard was construsted that synthesises data from Coca-Cola, key competitors, and industry reports, enabling real-time monitoring and predictive analysis of strategic and HR metrics. It was developed as part of a coursework assignment and offers practical business intelligence tools aligned with the company's competitive landscape.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- Secondary research using Statista, Google Trends, Mintel, and annual reports from Coca-Cola and competitors.
  

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

#### **Key Objectives**
- Identify Coca-Cola's strategic and HR challenges using **internal and external data sources**.
- **Benchmark** Coca-Cola’s metrics **against industry leaders** including PepsiCo, Nestle, and Keurig Dr Pepper.
- Provide **predictive insights into market trends** (e.g. e-commerce, DEI, energy drinks) and **internal HR metrics** (e.g. employee turnover rate, training and development costs).
- Create an **interactive dashboard** to visualise performance metrics across multiple business functions.
- Develop **strategic recommendations** to enhance Coca-Cola’s **competitive and operational efficiency**.

#### **Key Findings**
- Coca-Cola **outperforms** the industry average in **net profit margin** (21.2% vs. 10–12%), offering **greater reinvestment potential**.
- The company **lags in capital expenditure and e-commerce investment** relative to competitors, indicating **infrastructure gaps**.
- Despite strong DEI initiatives, Coca-Cola demonstrates **weaker transparency and representation** scores than Nestle and PepsiCo.
- Coca-Cola is **underrepresented in the energy and sports drink market**, accounting for just 5% of sales, compared to 10–15% for competitors.
- Predictive metrics such as Google Trends and CAGR data highlight **high-growth areas Coca-Cola must prioritise**: energy drinks, e-commerce, and advanced HR tech.

#### **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection & Preparation:**
- Gathered data from market, company and competitor reports.
- Estimations were made on information provided by market, company and competitor reports to be used as benchmarks for comparison to enhance the analsis.

2. **Metric Analysis and KPI Construction:**
- Developed tailored formulas for key metrics including Employee Efficiency, Compa Ratio, Training Cost per Employee, and Turnover Rate.
- Integrated Google Trends and CAGR data to assess future market movements in health-conscious consumer segments.

3. **Predictive Analytics:**
- Designed visual components to track CapEx, DEI, advertising, and training metrics.
- Built predictive capabilities using real-time proxies (e.g. Google search scores) and dummy data templates for future use.

4. **Strategic and HR Benchmarking:**
- Benchmarked Coca-Cola’s performance against direct competitors in operational investment, gender equality, employee engagement, and e-commerce sales.
- Developed monitoring systems for DEI progression and regional/departmental employee efficiency.

- Constructed flashcards, line charts, bar graphs, and donut charts to track Coca-Cola’s performance across HR and strategic metrics.
- Developed comparative visualisations using industry benchmarks derived from annual reports and financial data.

  
#### **Outcome & Business Recommendations**
- **Prioritise CapEx and e-commerce expansion**: Coca-Cola should increase capital allocation toward digital platforms and distribution infrastructure to match Nestle’s 2025 sales goals (25% e-commerce).
- **Optimise DEI strategy transparency**: Coca-Cola must enhance public reporting of DEI progress to improve stakeholder perception and competitive equity.
- **Expand product presence in high-growth markets**: With only 5% of sales in energy and sports drinks, Coca-Cola should consider acquiring or developing performance-focused brands to rival PepsiCo’s Gatorade or KDP’s C4.
- **Integrate advanced HR tech**: Tools such as VR training and AI-driven learning platforms can boost employee engagement while controlling training costs.
- **Adopt predictive KPIs**: Metrics like Pre-Hire Quality Satisfaction and Google Trend Scores offer forward-looking insights and should guide HR and product development strategies.
